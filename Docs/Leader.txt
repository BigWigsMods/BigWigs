    How to trigger custom bars for your raid

BigWigs comes prepacked with a means of starting your own custom bars. You 
can access it with /raidbar. Lets say you want to start a boss timer for an ability that
will happen in 60 seconds, you can do so with the following command /raidbar 60 INCOMING! 

    How to check what version other people have

Using /bwv, you can query the raid for what version of BigWigs your members have.

Remember that people do not always have to have the latest revision for things
to work, please do not abuse the version query as most people do not enjoy
upgrading things every day.

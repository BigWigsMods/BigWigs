# BigWigs Bossmods

## Introduction

**BigWigs** is a boss encounter add-on. It consists of many individual _encounter scripts_, or _boss modules_; mini add-ons that are designed to trigger alert messages, timer bars, sounds, and so forth, for one specific raid encounter.

Looking for functionality that BigWigs doesn't cover? Try these addons:
* [LittleWigs](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/little-wigs) is a plugin for Big Wigs and covers all forms of 5 man and solo content.
* [Capping](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/capping-bg-timers) covers various battleground and world PvP timers.
* [oRA3](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/ora3) covers all sorts of raid management functionality including raid cooldowns and Battle Res counting.
* Old content can be installed by [doing a search for BigWigs](https://mods.curse.com/search?search=bigwigs&submit-search=Submit) on Curse and installing the appropriate expansion addon.

## Feedback
Please remember that we are always interested in hearing directly from you. About anything you want to share or ask. You may [file tickets from our project page](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/BigWigs/issues) about anything or contact us on IRC in the #bigwigs channel on the irc.freenode.net server.

## Our goals
When raiding, a high framerate is important. We understand that every extra frame matters, so BigWigs aims to be as efficient as possible. The memory/second and CPU/second footprint of BigWigs is the lowest of all boss mod addons.
When modules are written, every aspect of the encounter is inspected. Is add-on synchronisation required? Is target scanning required? What events are really needed? 
We also aim to have the latest encounter scripts released ASAP; not long after the first few attempts of a brand new boss, we usually have a working encounter script for it.
